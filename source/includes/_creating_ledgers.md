- Ledgers are digital accounts. They can be held by endusers or customers.
  - There are two `ledger_types`: `single-user`, and `omnibus`. An omnibus account is an account which holds the funds of multiple entities and is usually held by the customer, whereas a single-user account is of course an account holding the finds of only one entity.
- Currently we provide GBP and EUR ledgers, with USD coming later this year.
- One ledger can hold a single asset only. For example, if an enduser wants to hold GBP and EUR, then the enduser needs at least two ledgers: one for GBP, and one for EUR
- Ledgers can also be 'virtual', with 'virtual' funds that can be manually credited and debited to them that are attached to a real world asset. For instance, a gold ledger that reflects a stock of gold in a vault.
- Debit Cards can be attached to ledgers.
- Funds can be sent to, from and between ledgers in the given currency. However, we cannot do inter-ledger transfers between two ledgers holding different currencies.

- This endpoint issues a ledger, assigning it to a particular holder.
- Endpoint: `POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers"`
- When GBP ledgers are issued the `uk_account_number` and `uk_sort_code` are automatically assigned, however, when EUR ledgers are issued, the `iban` and `bic_swift` are not automatically assigned â€“ the `POST v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban` endpoint is required to do this.
- Check out the `ledger_meta` field which allows you to add custom fields to the ledger, for instance, your own account number.
