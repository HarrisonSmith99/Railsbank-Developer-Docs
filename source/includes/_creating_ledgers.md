- Ledgers are digital accounts. They can be held by endusers or customers.
  - There are two `ledger_types`: `single-user`, and `omnibus`. An omnibus account is an account which holds the funds of multiple entities and is usually held by the customer, whereas a single-user account is of course an account holding the finds of only one entity.
- Currently we provide GBP and EUR ledgers, with USD coming later this year.
- One ledger can hold a single asset only. For example, if an enduser wants to hold GBP and EUR, then the enduser needs at least two ledgers: one for GBP, and one for EUR
- Ledgers can also be 'virtual', with 'virtual' funds that can be manually credited and debited to them that are attached to a real world asset. For instance, a gold ledger that reflects a stock of gold in a vault.
- Debit Cards can be attached to ledgers.
- Funds can be sent to, from and between ledgers in the given currency. However, we cannot do inter-ledger transfers between two ledgers holding different currencies.

## Issue a Ledger

}
```
- `POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers"`
- This endpoint issues a ledger, assigning it to a particular holder.
- When GBP ledgers are issued the `uk_account_number` and `uk_sort_code` are automatically assigned, however, when EUR ledgers are issued, the `iban` and `bic_swift` are not automatically assigned â€“ the `POST v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban` endpoint is required to do this.
- Check out the `ledger_meta` field which allows you to add custom fields to the ledger, for instance, your own account number.

- `POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/virtual"`
- Virtual Ledgers are ledgers that hold 'virtual' assets.
- Assets currently supported are gold, goldbloc, and whisky.
- They are designed to reflect an amount of the physical asset that an enduser might hold - in a vault, for instance.
- The assets can be manually credited and debited onto the ledgers.
- You can move the assets between virual ledgers using the inter-ledger function.
- You cannot convert assets on virtual ledgers into real assets on real ledgers.

| `ledger_meta` <br> _object_, optional | Extra information you want to add to the ledger in the form of custom fields |

## Assign a Ledger an IBAN

> **Example Request**

```shell
 --request POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban"
 --header "Content-Type: application/json"
 --header "Accept: application/json"
 --header "Authorization: API-Key <<yourAPI-Key>>"
```
> **Example Response**

```shell
{
 "ledger_id": "6630b391-c5ce-46c1-9d23-a82a9e27f82d"
}
```
- `POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban"`
- EUR ledgers are not automatically assigned an `iban` or `bic_swift` code upon creation.
- To do so, you need to save the `ledger_id` the API responded with when you created the ledger, wait a couple of seconds for the ledger to be created, before calling this endpoint.
- Our IBAN is reachable via the SEPA Step2 Payment Scheme.
- The assigning of the ledger may take a few seconds or it could take a few hours: it is dependent upon the partner bank. Usually, it takes seconds.

- Fetch a ledger to access the fundamental information about a ledger: the account details and balance.
- We advise that you add the `/wait` parameter on the end of the url. This means the API will wait until the ledger is in a 'rest' state, meaning it is usable.
  - This is useful because while the creation of a ledger is practically atomic, the assigning of an IBAN or an account number and sort code takes a couple of seconds. Wait allows them to be assigned before the ledger information is returned to you.

### API-Generated Fields: Fields that you did not input when creating the ledger:
| Attribute                            | Description                           |

| `ledger_status` <br> _string_        | The status of the ledger <br> _See below of Allowed Values_ \ |
| `last_modified_at` <br> _string_     | The timestamp of the last time the ledger was changed in some way - either a PUT was executed to update information or the ledger was credited or debited |
| `created_at` <br> _string_           | The timestamp of when the ledger was created |
| `iban` <br> _string_                 | The iban assigned to the ledger       |
| `bic_swift` <br> _string_            | The SWIFT Business Identifier Code    |
| `ledger_iban_status` <br> _string_   | The status of the iban <br> _Allowed Values:_ ledger-iban-status-pending, entity-status-unable-to-advance, ledger-iban-status-declined, ledger-iban-status-ok |
| `uk_account_number` <br> _string_    | The UK account number <br> _eight integers_ |

### Ledger Statuses
| Message                      | Description                                   |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `ledger-status-missing-data` | Extra data required to create the ledger. Often, this occurs if the holder of the ledger is missing the data required to generate a ledger. |
| `ledger-status-pending`      | The ledger is being created. To avoid fetching an ledger in this state, use our `/wait` parameter. |
| `ledger-status-error`        | The ledger has not been created properly. This occurs if the proposed holder of the ledger is in a state in which they are unable to hold the ledger, for instance, pending. |
| `ledger-status-ok`           | The ledger is ready to receive and send money to and from. You will receive a `type: entity-ready-to-use` webhook. |
| `ledger-status-declined`     | The ledger has been declined. For instance if the `"ledger_t_and_cs_country_of_jurisdiction":` is not acceptable to our compliance team. |
