- Ledgers are digital accounts. They can be held by endusers or customers.
  - There are two `ledger_types`: `single-user`, and `omnibus`. An omnibus account is an account which holds the funds of multiple entities and is usually held by the customer, whereas a single-user account is of course an account holding the finds of only one entity.
- Currently we provide GBP and EUR ledgers, with USD coming later this year.
- One ledger can hold a single asset only. For example, if an enduser wants to hold GBP and EUR, then the enduser needs at least two ledgers: one for GBP, and one for EUR
- Ledgers can also be 'virtual', with 'virtual' funds that can be manually credited and debited to them that are attached to a real world asset. For instance, a gold ledger that reflects a stock of gold in a vault.
- Debit Cards can be attached to ledgers.
- Funds can be sent to, from and between ledgers in the given currency. However, we cannot do inter-ledger transfers between two ledgers holding different currencies.

```
`POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers"`

- This endpoint issues a ledger, assigning it to a particular holder.
- When GBP ledgers are issued the `uk_account_number` and `uk_sort_code` are automatically assigned, however, when EUR ledgers are issued, the `iban` and `bic_swift` are not automatically assigned â€“ the `POST v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban` endpoint is required to do this.
- Check out the `ledger_meta` field which allows you to add custom fields to the ledger, for instance, your own account number.

  --header "Content-Type: application/json"
	--header "Accept: application/json"
	--header "Authorization: API-Key <<yourAPI-Key>>"

}
```
`POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/virtual"`

- Virtual Ledgers are ledgers that hold 'virtual' assets.
- Assets currently supported are gold, goldbloc, and whisky.
- They are designed to reflect an amount of the physical asset that an enduser might hold - in a vault, for instance.
- The assets can be manually credited and debited onto the ledgers.
- You can move the assets between virual ledgers using the inter-ledger function.
- You cannot convert assets on virtual ledgers into real assets on real ledgers.

### The Virtual Ledger Object
| Attribute                             | Description                          |

| `ledger_meta` <br> _object_, optional | Extra information you want to add to the ledger in the form of custom fields |

## Assign a Ledger an IBAN

> **Example Request**

```shell
 --request POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban"
 --header "Content-Type: application/json"
 --header "Accept: application/json"
 --header "Authorization: API-Key <<yourAPI-Key>>"
```
> **Example Response**

```shell
{
 "ledger_id": "6630b391-c5ce-46c1-9d23-a82a9e27f82d"
}
```
`POST "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}/assign-iban"`

- EUR ledgers are not automatically assigned an `iban` or `bic_swift` code upon creation.
- To do so, you need to save the `ledger_id` the API responded with when you created the ledger, wait a couple of seconds for the ledger to be created, before calling this endpoint.
- Our IBAN is reachable via the SEPA Step2 Payment Scheme.
- The assigning of the ledger may take a few seconds or it could take a few hours: it is dependent upon the partner bank. Usually, it takes seconds.

- Fetch a ledger to access the fundamental information about a ledger: the account details and balance.
- We advise that you add the `/wait` parameter on the end of the url. This means the API will wait until the ledger is in a 'rest' state, meaning it is usable.
  - This is useful because while the creation of a ledger is practically atomic, the assigning of an IBAN or an account number and sort code takes a couple of seconds. Wait allows them to be assigned before the ledger information is returned to you.

### Endpoints

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers/{{ledger_id}}/wait`

Get a ledger based on its UUID. This will allow you to discover the account details that can be used in the following endpoints.

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers/by-iban?iban={{YOUR_IBAN}}`

Get a ledger based on its IBAN.

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers/by-uk-bank-account?uk_account_number={{YOUR_UK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}}&uk_sort_code={{YOUR_UK_SORT_CODE}}`

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers?last_seen_id={{LEDGER_ID}}`

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers?items_per_page=25`

- This endpoint allows you to fetch multiple normal ledgers by the holder of the ledger and/or the partner product of the ledger.
- For instance, you might want to see all the GBP ledgers held by a particular enduser, or all the EUR ledgers held by the customer.
- The response can also be constricted to a particular timeframe or a `last_seen_id`. It can also be paginated to shorten the response time.
- All parameters are optional - you can simply fetch all the ledgers created using your API-Key in the given environment.
- At the same time, all parameters can be used. To add a parameter simply use the `&` symbol.
  - Use either the date-based parameters or the id-based parameters, not both.
  - When using parameters, don't place the strings within quotes.
- The response will be an array of ledger objects in the same format as if they had all been fetched individually.
- The response will be in the same format no matter the number of parameters used.

| `items_per_page` <br> _integer_ | The number of items returned in each page. A hyperlink to the next page will be found in the response headers |
| `created_at` <br> _string_      | The date that the list of ledgers will begin at: any ledger created before this date will not be returned. <br> _YYYY-MM-DD_ |
| `last_seen_id` <br> _string_    | The ledgers returned will have all been created after the ledger whose UUID is the `last_seen_id` |

## Fetch Recently Modified Ledgers

```shell
 --request GET "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/changed?from_date="2018-09-09""
 --header "Content-Type: application/json"
 --header "Accept: application/json"
 --header "Authorization: API-Key <<yourAPI-Key>>"
```
> **Example Response**

```shell
{
  "next_request_date": "2020-01-01",
  "ledgers": [
    {
      "ledger_id": "bb8b2428-f94c-41df-8e82-a895ab4d6ac8"
    },
    {
      "ledger_id": "8763b5df-a61c-4f77-9724-41ca9cde3654"
    },

    }
  ]
}
```

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers/changed?from_date="2018-09-09"`

- This endpoint allows you to fetch all the ledgers changed after a specified date, the `from_date` (YYYY-MM-DD).
- By changed, we mean ledgers that have been debited or credited.
- The call is optimized to be extremely fast and as such will only respond the UUIDs of the ledgers that have been changed. Not all their details.
- To fetch their details, iterate over each of them and call `GET v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}`.
- In the response is a field called `next_request_date`, this signifies the timestamp of the first actual changed after the specified `from_date`.

## Fetch Unassigned Ledgers
> **Example Request**

```shell
 --request GET "https://playlive.railsbank.com/v1/customer/ledgers/unassigned"
 --header "Content-Type: application/json"
 --header "Accept: application/json"
 --header "Authorization: API-Key <<yourAPI-Key>>"
```

    },
    {
      "ledger_id": "8763b5df-a61c-4f77-9724-41ca9cde3654"
    },
    {
      "ledger_id": "8763b5df-a61c-4f77-9724-41ca9cde3654"
    }
]
```

`GET /v1/customer/ledgers/unassigned`

- This endpoint simply fetches the ledgers that do not have a holder.
- The response will be an array of ledger UUIDs. To fetch their details you will need to iterate over each of them and call `GET v1/customer/ledgers/{{LEDGER_ID}}`.
- To assign a ledger to a holder, call `POST /v1/customer/ledgers/{ledger_id}/assign` with the `holder_id` in the request body.

## Assign a Ledger to a Holder
