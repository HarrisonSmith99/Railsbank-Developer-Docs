# Welcome
## What We Do
Railsbank is an open Banking and Compliance platform that enables **Customers** to create their own products that need banking capabilities or integrate banking capabilities into their systems, apps and workflows.

**Customers** connect to the platform via the **Customer API** and access financial products through what we call **Product Rails** - a full list of the cabilities available via the Railsbank **Product Rails** can be seen below or on our [main website](https://www.railsbank.com/).

The platform is purely an API, built to be easily and rapidly integrated into your business. Railsbank is all about making your life super simple to integrate a complete set of financial services capabilities into your business, app, or product.

## Using this Documentation
This documentation is aimed at technologists and developers interested in the API. It is split into three parts:

1. An overview of the key aspects of Railsbank
2. Guides which will walk you through some of the common scenarios in which the API is used, allowing you to quickly understand the technology.
3. Detailed documentation of every endpoint, categorised by capability.

On the right side of your screen you will see code examples which can be pasted into a testing tool like [Postman] (https://www.getpostman.com), or into your terminal.
