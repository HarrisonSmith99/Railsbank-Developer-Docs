# What We Do

Railsbank is an open Banking and Compliance platform that enables **Customers** to create their own products that need banking capabilities or integrate banking capabilities into their systems, apps and workflows.

**Customers** connect to the platform via the **Customer API** and access financial products through what we call **Product Rails** - a full list of the cabilities available via the Railsbank **Product Rails** can be seen below or on our [main website](https://www.railsbank.com/).

The platform is purely an API, built to be easily and rapidly integrated into your business. Railsbank is all about making your life super simple to integrate a complete set of financial services capabilities into your business, app, or product.

These guides are designed to help anyone and everyone - from CEOs to developers - understand how easy it is to operate the API. However, if you want a more detailed, development-focused documents after going through them, head to the [API Docs](https://docs.railsbank.com/).
